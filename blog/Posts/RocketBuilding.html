                                <p>
                                    Students built model rockets during our latest meeting! We organized into teams of 4-5 members, which fostered collaboration and communication as we quickly got to work. Each team followed detailed instructions provided by our guides and student leads, ensuring that everyone understood the building process. As the excitement grew, we witnessed creativity flourish as teams customized their rocket designs, incorporating unique elements that reflected their innovative ideas. Teams that successfully completed their model rockets will have the thrilling opportunity to test flight next meeting! This will not only allow us to see the fruits of our hard work but also give us valuable feedback for future designs and improvements. Please make sure to prepare for this exciting challenge and ensure your rockets are ready for launch!

                                <p>
                                    We are thrilled to announce that we will be moving to bigger rockets very soon! This transition opens up exciting opportunities for exploring advanced rocket designs and launching techniques. With larger rockets, we can experiment with various materials, engineering concepts, and propulsion systems that will enhance our understanding of rocketry and physics. This development will allow us to take our skills to new heights—literally! We can’t wait to see what incredible creations you all come up with as we embark on this new phase of our project. It's an exciting time for our program, and we are eager to explore the possibilities that lie ahead!
